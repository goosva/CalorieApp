This project is meant to test ChatGPT coding capabilities. I will be attempting to create a MyFitnessPal Clone through ChatGPT prompts with minimal help.

Testing ChatGPT as a Web Developer: A MyFitnessPal Clone Experiment
AI has been evolving rapidly, with increasing discussion about large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT potentially replacing software developers. Inspired by this conversation, I designed a project to test whether ChatGPT could create a basic website through natural language interaction alone. The goal was to see how far AI could go in building a MyFitnessPal-style web application, with minimal human coding input.
I began by asking ChatGPT to create a login page that would authenticate users and redirect them to a home page. It succeeded in generating a working login form with basic redirection. This initial success gave me confidence that ChatGPT could handle simple, functional components.
As I progressed, I attempted to add a search bar to the home page. Initially, the search bar worked as expected. However, after I requested the element to be centered, the search functionality broke. Further prompts to correct the issue led to increasingly inconsistent behavior and new bugs. Despite multiple iterations and attempts to refine the prompt, I had to revert to the original, working version.
Next, I explored implementing basic login security. For testing purposes, I used hard-coded usernames and passwords. ChatGPT generated code that enforced authentication correctly, users could only proceed with matching credentials. I then tried to enhance this by preventing users from accessing restricted pages by clicking the browser's back button after logout. ChatGPT suggested solutions, but none worked as intended. After many attempts, this feature remained unresolved.
After a week of working on this project, I concluded that while LLMs like ChatGPT can assist with coding, they currently cannot replace the expertise of a skilled developer. While the model is impressively fast and often helpful, building a full-featured website solely through conversation revealed its limitations. You must already understand the language and tools you're using in order to evaluate and correct the modelâ€™s output.
In its current state, AI can significantly enhance developer productivity but not eliminate the need for technical knowledge. Relying on LLMs without understanding the code risks introducing bugs and security vulnerabilities. Rather than replacing developers, AI is a powerful tool that can empower them to work more efficiently, provided they understand how to use it properly.
