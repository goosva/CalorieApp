# CalorieApp

This project is meant to test ChatGPT's coding capabilities. I attempted to create a MyFitnessPal clone entirely through ChatGPT prompts with minimal manual intervention.

## üß™ Project Goal

To evaluate how effectively ChatGPT can generate a functioning website by building a basic calorie tracker (MyFitnessPal clone) through natural language instructions‚Äîwithout writing the code myself.

## ‚úÖ Features Attempted

- [x] Login page with basic authentication
- [x] Home page redirection after login
- [x] Search bar on the home page
- [x] Hardcoded username/password verification
- [ ] Prevent access to restricted pages after logout (via browser back button)

## üìå Project Conclusion

### *Testing ChatGPT as a Web Developer: A MyFitnessPal Clone Experiment*

AI is evolving rapidly, with increasing discussion around large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT potentially replacing software developers. Inspired by this, I designed a project to test whether ChatGPT could build a basic web application solely through conversation.

The goal was to replicate core features of MyFitnessPal using only ChatGPT‚Äôs responses to natural language prompts.

#### üß© What Worked:
- ChatGPT successfully created a working login page that redirected to a home page.
- The initial search bar was functional.
- Authentication using hardcoded credentials worked as expected.

#### üêû What Didn't:
- When I asked ChatGPT to center the search bar, it broke the search functionality entirely.
- Attempts to fix the issue through additional prompts led to more bugs, not solutions.
- Efforts to prevent users from accessing restricted pages after logout (e.g., via the browser's back button) were unsuccessful, despite multiple iterations.

## ü§ñ Final Thoughts

After a week of experimenting, I concluded:

- ChatGPT is fast and often helpful for generating basic components.
- However, building and maintaining a fully functional site requires technical knowledge.
- LLMs do not yet replace skilled developers but can **amplify productivity** for those with coding experience.
- Blindly relying on AI-generated code without understanding it introduces potential bugs and security risks.

**Conclusion:** ChatGPT is a powerful *coding assistant*, not a replacement for software engineers‚Äîat least for now.

## üí° Future Improvements

- Implement proper session handling and logout protections
- Connect to a real database for user credentials and food tracking
- Add calorie counting and progress tracking features
